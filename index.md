## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="self.jpeg">

Hi, I'm Yuexin Zhang, born in Zhongxiang, Hubei Province, China. Zhongxiang (Chengtian Fu) is the birth place of the Jiajing Emperor in the Ming Dynasty, thus making it politically equal to Beijing (Shuntian Fu) and Nanjing (Yingtian Fu) in the 16th-17th century. You may know Jiajing from the classic TV series [Ming Dynasty in 1566](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty_in_1566), which I also feel like a mirror of modern China.

I obtained BSc (honor) in physics at Fudan University in 2019 and then PhD in astronomy at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen in 2023. Now I am an NWO Rubicon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian.

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on observational high-energy astrophysics. I am interested in the physical phenomena that result from accretion onto compact objects. By analyzing spectral-timing-polarimetric data from X-ray band to radio band, we can better understand the accretion modes, the disc-corona-jet behavior, disc winds, origin of relativistic jets, and etc., which contribute to our understanding of the geometry around and of the compact objects, and studying general-relativistic effects in the vicinity of compact objects.

<!-- > While all of these areas are easy to start with, it is quite complicated to further digest and do research. Previous efforts may push us towards ultimate goal.
> - With the confusing actual problems, how to solve these questions remains unknown.
> - Structual modeling of problem, complex relationships and simulation processes in the structure of the models.

> And I am on the way of these explorations and I have reach some achievements. -->
