## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="self.jpeg">

Hi, I'm Yuexin Zhang, born in Zhongxiang, Hubei Province, China. Now I work as an astro PhD candidate @ Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. 

<br>

## Research Interest

My research mainly focus on observational high energy astrophysics. I am interested in the physical phenomena that results from accretion onto compact objects. By analysing spectral and timing data of X-ray, we can better understand the accretion modes, the disc-corona behavior, disc winds, origin of relativistic jets, and etc., which contribute to our understanding of the geometry around and of the compact objects, and studying general-relativistic effects in the vicinity of compact objects

<!-- > While all of these areas are easy to start with, it is quite complicated to further digest and do research. Previous efforts may push us towards ultimate goal.
> - With the confusing actual problems, how to solve these questions remains unknown.
> - Structual modeling of problem, complex relationships and simulation processes in the structure of the models.
>
> And I am on the way of these explorations and I have reach some achievements. -->
